#In fact, there are not many values that evaluate to False, except empty values, such as (), [], {}, "", the number 0, and the value None. And of course the value False evaluates to False.

#The following will return False:

bool(False)
bool(None)
bool(0)
bool("")
bool(())
bool([])
bool({})

print(bool(False))
print(bool(None))
print(bool(0))
print(bool(""))
print(bool(()))
print(bool([]))
print(bool({}))


#One more value, or object in this case, evaluates to False, and that is if you have an object that is made from a class with a __len__ function that returns 0 or False:

class myclass():
  def __len__(self):
    return 0

myobj = myclass()
print(bool(myobj))
