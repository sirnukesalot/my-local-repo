#Global Variables
#Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
#Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

#Create a variable inside a function, with the same name as the global variable
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
