#In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, 
#Python will give you an error:
"""
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)
"""

#The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, 
#which even support different data types:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
